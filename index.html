The intention above was originally when this site went live for testing
before it started becoming an active demo/project thing was to have an ASCII LINUX banner type of thing on top.

I was messing around in vim and accidentally/intentionally broke the formatting so I just started entering random shit
to test with and left it there for the laugh since I couldn't think of anything else at the time :D
